## Technologies

### Linux (Experienced)

Linux plays a strong role in my daily life. My main desktop computer has been running Arch for well over a year and previously ran Ubuntu for a time before that. Working with Arch, I've become very comfortable with the terminal and recovering my system from a broken state. At times there has been challenges without an adequate solution on Linux such as playing StarCraft II. To overcome these I've created a QEMU virtual machine running Windows 10 complete with a graphics card. The ease at which new software can be installed and updated in Linux alongside with tools such as ssh and rsync I've never looked back.

### Git (Experienced)

For a long time I've simply viewed GitHub as a way to save code and possible transfer it across systems. In classes, I was introduced to Git as a version control system and taught about branches, the stash, checkout, and more. Since then Git has been a great collaborative tool and has aided me greatly in both Screeps and more complicated projects alike.

### Gradle (Intermediate)

For Java projects Gradle is my go-to build tool this is since Gradle can be setup very easily and be used to build standalone projects with little issue. For some projects, I've used Gradle to automatically deploy my code to a server for testing. Additionally when projects do require dependencies Gradle can be used to pull them from Maven Central and other repositories.

### Maven (Beginner)

Although Maven is no longer my go-to build tool, I've worked with Maven quite a bit when developing Minecraft plugins. Maven is the default build tool in the template project for Spigot and makes it very easy to add other Minecraft server architecture or plugins as dependencies for a project. Where Maven initaly fell apart for me was in standalone projects and automatic deployment. 

### Spring Boot (Beginner)

Currently in class my group is building a media review app. For this course I've been working on the back end side of things with Spring Boot and MySQL as my two areas of focus. In Spring Boot I've been able to send request media files (such as images), enforce HTTPS communications to protect passwords, and encode passwords so they're not saved in plain text.

### MySQL (Beginner)

Again for a class project I've been working on back end and have been set up the MySQL server along with the communications between Spring Boot and MySQL. Then in Spring Boot created the tables for MySQL.

## Languages

### Java (Experienced)

Java is my go-to langauge for just about anything that doesn't heavily depend on performance. It is the langauge I have the most experience with, and through use of pattern matching, lambda references, and the built in libraries most things are fairly straight forward to implement. 

### C++ (Intermediate)

Of course Java has it's downfalls at which point I turn to C++. C++ contains a lot of the features I'm familar with in Java whilst having higher performance overall.

### C (Beginner)

Finally when nessicary I can use C to program at a system level.
