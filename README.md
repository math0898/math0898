### Linux (Experienced)

Linux plays a strong role in my daily life. My main desktop computer has been running Arch for well over a year and previously ran Ubuntu for a time before that. Working with Arch, I've become very comfortable with the terminal and recovering my system from a broken state. At times there has been challenges without an adeqeut solution on Linux such as playing Starcraft II. To overcome these I've created a QEMU virutal machine running Windows 10 complete with a graphics card. The ease at which new software can be installed and updated in Linux along side with tools such as ssh and rsync I've never looked back.
